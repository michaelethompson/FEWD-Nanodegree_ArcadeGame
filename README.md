The object is to use the arrow keys to move the boy to the top row. 
IF the boy collides with a bug, he goes back to the start.
When the boy makes it to the top row without colliding with a bug, He is safe, and a new boy appears at the start.
Once all the slots in the top row are filled, the game starts over with bugs and obstacles moving faster.
